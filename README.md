# FastAPI Todo CRUD App

A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with FastAPI. Data are stored in a local `db.json` file. This project is intended as a lightweight example and is ready to push to GitHub.

## Features

- Create a new todo item
- Retrieve all todos
- Retrieve a single todo by ID
- Update an existing todo
- Delete a todo
- Basic validation using Pydantic models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (or compatible)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) for installing packages

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Fast_api_web_app-main
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows PowerShell
   & venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # macOS / Linux
   # source venv/bin/activate
   # Note: If 'python' is not recognized, try 'py' instead
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

4. (Optional) Install development dependencies such as `requests` if you plan to run the example client code or tests:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

### Running the App

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

By default the app will run at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

You can explore the interactive API documentation at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) or the OpenAPI schema at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json).

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path            | Description                 |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/v1/create`| Create a new todo           |
| GET    | `/api/v1/`      | Get all todos               |
| GET    | `/api/v1/{id}`  | Get todo by ID              |
| PUT    | `/api/v1/{id}`  | Update todo by ID           |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/{id}`  | Delete todo by ID           |

`Todo` model schema:
```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "desc": "string",
  "isComplete": false
}
```

### Notes

- The local `db.json` file will be created automatically when the first todo is added. It is ignored by default in `.gitignore` to avoid committing private or test data.
- This project is intentionally kept simple for learning and demonstration purposes. In a production application, you would likely use a real database and add authentication, error handling, etc.
